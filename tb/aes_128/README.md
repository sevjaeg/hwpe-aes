 AES (Rijndael) IP Core (128 bit version)

From https://github.com/www-asics-ws/aes_128

Description

Simple AES (Rijndael) IP Core. I have tried to balance this implementation and to trade
off size and performance. The goal was to be able to fit in to a low cost Xilinx Spartan
series FPGA and still be as fast as possible. As one can see from the implementation
results below, this goal has been achieved ! Other Implementations of this standard with
different key sizes (192 & 256 bit) and performance attributes (like a fully pipelined
ultra-high-speed version) are commercially available from ASICS.ws. Even though no official
testing has been performed we believe that this core is fully complies to FIPS-197 (pdf).
For more information see the core documentation.
